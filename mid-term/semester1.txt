In Semester One, I developed foundational skills in web development. One of my key projects was a Simple ToDo App, which allowed users to create, edit, and delete tasks. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reinforcing my understanding of front-end development principles. Additionally, I created a Personal Website using only HTML and CSS, which served as my online portfolio. This project not only showcased my work but also honed my design skills and taught me the importance of responsive layouts for different devices.
