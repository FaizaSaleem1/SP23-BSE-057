During Semester Two, I took my skills a step further by working on more complex applications. I developed an E-commerce Website using React.js, where users could browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. This project involved integrating RESTful APIs to fetch product data and implementing user authentication. Additionally, I created a Weather App that used JavaScript and API integration to display real-time weather data for any location. This project deepened my understanding of asynchronous programming and data manipulation in JavaScript.
