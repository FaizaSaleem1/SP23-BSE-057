In Semester Three, I shifted my focus to full-stack development. One of my major projects was a Social Media App built with Node.js and MongoDB. This application allowed users to create profiles, post updates, and connect with friends. Implementing features like user authentication and real-time updates taught me valuable lessons in back-end development and database management. Additionally, I designed my Portfolio Website as a full-stack application, utilizing technologies such as Express.js and a MongoDB database to store project details. This project emphasized the importance of showcasing my work dynamically and interactively.
